* running crazy 8 session with the whole team
* developing low-fi prototype

**Hypothesis to validate**
We believe that practitioners need help identifying areas they need additional support in.

**Underlying user need**
I need to be able to easily find and access relevant guidance and training so that I know what is good quality and suitable for me.
