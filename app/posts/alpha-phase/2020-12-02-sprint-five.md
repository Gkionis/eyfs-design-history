Whilst the sprint four findings were still being analysed, we had a product direction to prototype what the service could look like outside of Whitehall cms.

#### Hypothesis to validate

* We believe that [some] practitioners will need additional support to enable them to implement changes

#### User need

* I need training on the reforms for me and my team, so that I can check my knowledge and make sure we are all doing the right thing

Additional user needs were captured and aligned with the future product vision of this service. More on that can be found on the Alpha assessment deck. Contact rinto.cyriac@education.gov.uk for more details.

## Where we are at currently

The current designs need to be tested with users to understand:

* how users use navigation to get to topic areas especially if they are on mobile
* users finding our service and the unknown user journeys
* how usable is our service on mobile
* how users are able to apply the learnings from our service into their practice
